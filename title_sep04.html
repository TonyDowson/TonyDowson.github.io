<p>There has been a slight lack of updates as you regularly readers might have seen. As I write this on the eve of testing at Cadwell, my year has been pretty much up and down.

<h2>Down</h2>
<p>First test of the year at Silverstone. We shared a pit garage with the GAC guys and that kept us out of a flesh freezing Silverstone wind for which we were grateful. Unfortunately the car also wanted to stay in the garage all day because everytime I went out on the circuit it misfired badly. We tried replacing every electrical/fuel component to stop a the misfire. Ian stripped the carb twice and still it did not cure it. We packed the car up minus the carb which was going back to Chesterfield to be hit with a hammer or cleaned more.

<h2>On the way up</h2>
<p>Success no misfire. We were off and running. So I tried to run the engine in during practice in the middle of a storm and a filth wet circuit. The clutch was slipping and I had no idea what the handling was doing. Still there was no misfire. My heat race last about 200 metres as I went to change to second and dis engaged the clutch... well it didn't the revs shot up and the car didn't gain any speed. I coasted rather neatly into the pits from my grid slot. A bit of head scratching and we relaised the clutch stop had moved forward and was not allowing the clutch pedal to come back far enough. Soon rectified I went out onto the circuit only to put my big size 11s in the wrong place and move the plate in again. I coasted into the paddock repaired the damage by hooking my foot behind the clutch and yanking back and made my way to the pits to get back into the race. A most unusual lap via the paddock. Anyway no use because the race had been red flagged. The clerk of the course was interested in my unusual lap.

<p>I was not in the final becuase I had not finished or done a proper lap in the heat. But a bit of pleading and they let me into the race where I managed to keep more size 11s in the right place. I finished the race quite well down and the handling didn't feel great. A step in the right direction.

<h2>Peaking</h2>
In the pits at Donnington we found the left rear was toeing out a few degrees. Once corrected the car felt good and my acid test is taking Craner curves flat without feeling the car is on the utter limit. It sailed through on less the perfect lines. A shortened practice session left me in a very happy 9th place on the grid. In the race I made a positive start and even found myself overtaking Bill Burnett into the Esses which he quickly claimed back. I had a few tussles and a enjoyable race came to a close with a 14th place.

<h2>Down</h2>
<p>Well it started ok. Then a chain of event led to my early demise. In practice I overcooked it through Russell and went wide over the grass. The subsequent jumping around broke the mountings for the carb. With no carb attached to the manifold I ground to halt and had to watch from the sidelines. Under the circumstance I was reasonably happy with 17th.

<p>We glued (yes glued) the carb mounting plate back on to the inlet manifold and hey presto with the carb in the right place, the engine worked. But within 400 metres of the start of the race I realised I could not get full throttle. It was more like half. So I shot down Revitt straight and half speed and people merrily picked me off. Around the corners it was not too bad I could at least thrown the car in and have some fun but then too came to a halt on the second lap when with a stationary Jez Clark in the middle of the track, Peter Cann spun and I was went down the inside of him he spun back into my path and just clipped my rear wheel. The force was enough to take it clean off. Very suprising. So the car went off to Chesterfield for some much needed love and attention.

<p>On the up again</h2>
After a length break we were back in action at Brands..... (soon to be written)
