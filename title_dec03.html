<h2>November/December</h2>

<p>After the last round at Mallory, the engine went North for Ian to rebuild and the car went South to my garage. Later, in December, I would bring the car back to Chesterfield for its annual checkup and fettling. The job list for this year is

<ul>
<li>Replace the steel fuel tank with an aluminum one to make the car lighter. We weighed the steel one at a shade over 5 kilos. An aluminum one weighs under 2 kilos. Its the only major part left on the car where we can loose a good proportion of weight. Also the steel one is rusting inside. When we first started racing the fuel filter would get clogged up with rust every few races. Its better now after Ian cleaned it but there ain't nothing like a brand new one. And another reason is so we can fit a larger tank. The steel tank holds about 13 litres but we are keen to have a foray into Europe this year to race in the German Vee series. The races are longer than the UK ones and a tank of 15 litres would comfortable allow us (we hope) to complete the race distance.
<li>Lower the seating position. Always been higher than most people in the car. We tried fitting a windshield to the car to deflect the air over my helmet but nothing beats sitting lower - more aerodynamic and lower centre of gravity. The plan is to move the pedals an inch forward which means moving the brake cylinders outside of the car because at the moment they are squashed tight against the bulkhead. The seat is mounted to the chassis by a bracket. By lowering the bracket, the seat will be lowered and more raked. With these 2 modifications I will be sat more horizontal and lower.
<li>Fix the gear change. Throughout the season I have struggled to get gears. With the engine out we think we have found what the problem is. The rod from the gear lever unit to the block holding the rod in place is over a metre long. This length of rod is flexing when the gear level is pulled back for second or fourth. So if the gear selector is not precisely above the gate for second or fourth then the rod would just flex and not select the gear. With the rod held halfway, therefore reducing the flex, the gears became easier to select. So without the rod flexing we reckon we'll get the same result.
<li>Rebuild the engine. We had not rebuilt the engine during the summer so it had done 11 races. Once Ian had stripped it down he noticed a small crack around the exhaust valve. This could have been causing the misfire at Mallory and also explain why the spark plug in that cylinder is covered in soot every time we remove it. So some new heads have been ordered. As many people will tell you the power is in the heads. The heads we have been using have been refined over the years with some porting work by John Mitchell and Ian but they've never seen a gas flow bench. With some brand new heads, properly gas flowed with our inlet manifolds, here's hoping for more power..!
</ul>

<p>The Formula Vee end of season party was held at the Northampton Moat House. I enjoyed the evening and was thrilled to pickup 3rd place in the Vee Centre Challenge. Its great to talk to drivers/people who you don't normal talk to and to put names to faces. I retired to bed at about 3am ish with many people still drinking in the bar. The next day I had a mighty hangover...

<p>The fixture list for next year was revealed in the regs. The fixtures are -
<ul>
<li>14th March - Mallory
<li>21st March - Donnington
<li>11th April - Snetterton
