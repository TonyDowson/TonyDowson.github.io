Oulton park and its wet. First race in the wet and first race at Oulton. Luckily the Vees had the garages so we could at 
least keep dry. The scrutineer found a problem with the steering rack bolt which we fixed. For practice the rain seemed 
to be coming down more. I ventured out onto the track and did a very slow lap to get a feel for the conditions and 
the track. The visibility was appalling, particularly when trying to follow another car. And not to help matters my helmet 
misted up after leaving the assembly area. As I started lap 2 I accelerated up to Old Hall and 
Craig Davis came past me on the pit straight. He turned into the first corner and aquaplaned off the circuit and 
into the barrier. Right on the apex was a huge puddle. I gave it a wide berth and made it round the corner. 
I made a mental note to forget the apex at Old Hall for the rest of practice. For the next 4 laps I concentrated on being 
smooth, learning the circuit and avoiding the worst puddles. The startline marshal showed me the "lights on" sign 3 times so I came into 
the pits. A dodgy connection was making the rear light go on and off. I accelerated out again and did another 2 laps 
and the session ended. Didn’t think I done particular well so I was happy with qualifying 8th.
<p>The track was much drier for the race. A marshal told me the righthand side of the grid was oily, luckily I was on 
the left. I got a good start off the grid and shot past the guys on the row in front of me and was gaining on the 
leaders when the first corner arrived. I went around in 5th place and a couple of cars elbowed their way past going

down to Cascade. I decided to let them go. Now I was driving on a fairly dry Oulton park. Dry and wet tracks have 
different lines and limits. I didn’t know the limits of the car on this track and so I took it easy. The guy in front 
of me accelerated too hard coming out of Knickerbrook and lost the backend. He spun in front of me but I chose the right
side to pass him. I saw in my mirror him spin back across 
the track and people slowing to avoid hitting him. This gave me some breathing space. Tearing down to Lodge corner I braked 
too early and somehow missed the apex and on the exit I spun it. I did a 360 and ended up facing the right away. I let 
a pack of cars past and accelerated after them. I caught them a lap later and started dicing with them. I lined up a nice
move, geting good traction and speed out of Old Hall, I thought I could overtake a couple of cars in front of me on the brakes into
Knickerbrook but as we went down the hill at Dentons I could see the racing drivers worst nightmare when trying
to overtake, the yellow flag ahead. I slowed and pulled behind the car I was trying to overtake. But the guy
behind me didn't see them and overtook me. About a lap later, he overtook a guy into Knickerbrook and I followed him through. 
One place made up and then a gift he spun in front of me. I missed him and got another place.
I then caught Craig Higgins but didn't find a way past. I was happy to have made it to the finish of the race and season.
