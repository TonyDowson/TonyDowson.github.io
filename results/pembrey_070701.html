<h3>What a lot of racing.</h3>

<p>The meeting was a double header. Two races in one weekend. Having never raced at Pembrey I thought it advisable to test. The Vee club had arranged 4 * 45 mintues sessions for 100 quid. I watched the weather forecast all week. It looked like it was going to be wet but how wet ? When it rains on the south coast of Wales it rains. 

<p>I missed the first session but it was cut short anyway. And missed the start of the second session but I still had time to get out on the track and do 25 laps. The car understeered in the two slow hairpins. I had had the engine rebuilt since Snetterton and a more advanced cam was fitted. So the engine needed to be revved hard. Getting around brooklands hairpin and keeping the revs up in the wet was beyond me. The third session was I would say wetter and did another 20 laps. Before the fourth session the rain had stopped and the track was drying quickly. The left tyre had about 2mm of tread and at one part very little due to locking it up trying to slow down for the hairpin. If it was wet tomorrow I would be struggling with grip. So we decided to do 20 minutes of the session then whizz into the paddock and remove the front wheels and dash to the local tyre place to get some new rubber fitted.

<p>The fourth session with a dry track was going to be crucial. Two laps it was red flagged. An incident at the first corner. Once cleared I managed about 3 laps before I pulled off into the pits worried about the oil pressure dipping in the Brooklands hairpin. I decided to call it a day and get the tyres fitted when the session was red flagged. An accident at Paddock bend and Andy Metcalf is trapped in his car. Andy is extracted and taken to hospital with a broken pelvis.

<p><hr><b>Fastest Practice Lap: 1:20.573<hr></b>

I was in the first practice session with the fast boys. This unexpectedly helped me because 4 laps into the session the track became very slippy. I could see a streak of oil/petrol around the entire circuit. After 3 spins and plodding around I decided to call it a day. Back in the paddock everyone else was complaining about the lack of grip. I watched the second session delicately go around. The track was not going to clear and nobody beat my time. I wound up 16th in the session and 6th on the grid for the first heat.

<p><hr><b>Heat 1: Grid Position: 6<br>
Heat 1: Race Result (10 laps) : 15 - 11:56.855 - 73.11MPH<br>
Heat 1: Fastest Lap: 1:09.559<hr></b>

Yet another poor start. I lose a 4 places before the first corner and my caution on the first lap means I lose a few more places by the end of the lap. I begin to hold station. An uneventful race but I am consious of losing too many places and not making the final. So I press on determined and with a few laps to go the guy behind is catching and I am thinking I need to stay ahead to get into the final. Going into the last lap he's right behind me. Thorugh the hairpin and paddock bend I am OK. Going into Brookland hairpin he tries a move up the inside. But I figure a tight line around there would be a slow exit. So I give him the space, let him past and then retake the place accelerating to Honda Curve. 

<p><hr><b>Final 1: Grid Postion: 25<br>
Final 1: Race Result (10 laps) : 20 - 11:50.229 - 73.8MPH<br>
Final 1: Fastest Lap: 1:08.313<hr></b>

For the final I am 25th.

<p><hr><b>Heat 2: Grid Postion: <br>
Heat 2: Race Result (10 laps) : 15 - 11:49.934 - 73.83MPH<br>

For the second heat I am .... on the grid and very determined to get a good start. The lights flick from red to green and I am off. I pass a couple before the first corner. Bill Burnett passes me and I follow him and go tight at the hairpin. Chaos on the outside of the hairpin and there are cars spining and other avoiding the spinner. I avoid it all. I must have made up 7-8 places. I am thrilled and I am charging. Then there are red flags. The race has been stopped. I am unhappy but what can you do. I sit at the back of the grid in my slot, watching each car saunter past to retake their original grid position, I am little surprise to see everyone back. So the race appears to have been stopped for the benefit of the drivers who spun at the first hairpin. I make a mental note that if I should spin perhaps I should sit in the middle of the track and get the race red flagged.

<p>On the restart, you guessed it, not such a good start. I maintain my position and again take a tight line at the hairpin to make a couple of places but as I come out of the hairpin there is somebody right in front of me going slowly, pulling off the circuit. Nothing I can do but curse my luck and lose the couple of positions I gained. 

<p><hr><b>Final 2: Grid Postion: <br>
Final 2: Race Result (9 laps) : 24 - 11:36.322 - 67.74MPH<br>
Final 2: Fastest Lap: 1:10.415<hr></b>

The second final is on Sunday morning. The track is damp/wet off line. I am on the back of the grid and make a decent start. I start to get the feel off the track. Richard Harris spins at the hairpin and I nip past. The drivers in front seem to be braking too early at the hairpin. Coming out of Honda I get a good tow and launch past Aaron. As I edge in front of him I leave my braking later than I would have liked for the hairpin. I apply the brake and keep calm. It feels it wont stop because I am off line on the damp. I can see Peter K on the outside and I hoping he doesn't turn in on me. He doesn't and I scramble around. I've made up two places in two corners and I pull away from Richard, Peter and Aaron. I am starting to catch the next group ahead when I spin. I am now flat last and in amongst the leaders. I keep pace well with the leaders but I also keep out of their way. I finish last and lapped but happy with my mini charge and my pace.
