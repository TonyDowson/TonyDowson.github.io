<p><b><hr>Fastest Practice Lap: 1:24:06 - 83.82 MPH<hr></b>

<p>The Vees were racing on Saturday and were first on. A 8:25
scrutineering meant getting out of bed at 5am. Practice started  ok. A
bit of reading the Autosport Guide had awaken me to a decent line into
Redgate, something I struggled to master on my 2  previous Donnington
visits. Craner Curve was the usual flat out affair and the Old Hairpin
on my fastest laps was hustled  through in fourth gear. McLeans was
terrible driven as before and I felt I had lost something at Coppice
and on reflection the Esses was not attacked enough. My lap timing
showed my eratic lapping and a 1:24.06. 3 seconds faster than my last
visit. It put me 2nd on the grid for the heat. No automatic
qualification to the final. Still a bit more practice around Donnington
wouldn't do no harm and chance of a victory (although slight hollow).

<p><hr><b>Heat: Grid Position: 2nd<br>
Heat: Race Result: 4th<br>
Heat: Fastest Lap: 1:24.39 - 83.50 MPH<hr></b>

<p>In between practice and the race I decided on the areas I would find
some time. A better line at Coppice, carry more speed  into MacLeans and
attack the chicane. At the start, I wheelspun a bit but then missing
second gear totally knackered up my  start leaving me in 10th at the end
of the first lap. This didn't concern me because I knew I get back some
places but first  place was now out of the question. The next few laps I
enjoyed some overtaking and dicing - the pulling off of a 3 abreast
lunge down the inside into the chicane being the highlight. By the end I
had pulled myself up to 4th and had enjoyed the  race. Of the areas I
wanted to improve, I did attack the Esses but the rest I had not
improved and I thought I was worse through the Old Hairpin.

<p><hr><b>Final: Grid Position: 17th<br>
Final: Race Result: 22nd<br>
Final: Fastest Lap: 1:24.42 - 83.47 MPH<hr></b>

<p>So for the final I was 22nd. Another naff start meant another charge.
I made up a few places but the car seemed to have  lost its edge. It was
smoking a fair bit and sounding rough. I was behind Steve Glasswell and
when Steve went wide at  Redgates and slowed to avoid going off I jinked
to the right to get around him not realising that Adrian Weston was
coming up  the inside. We touched and I saw Adrian go onto 2 wheel.
Luckily for him it came back down on 4 wheels. I continued on and  the
car's handling felt fine. Tough cars these Vees. With the car sounding
rougher and rougher I was driving with one eye on the oil pressure gauge
and then suddenly the chequered flag popped out 2 laps early. It turned
out later the race was stopped early because of safety issues. An
incident at Coppice had left 2 cars close to the edge of the circuit
caught in  the gravel trap.

<p>I enjoyed the racing but wish I had made a better start in the heat and challanged for the lead. It did cross my mind, what do I need to do if I win - would the commentator want to talk to me ? I'll cross that bridge (hopefully soon) when I come to it.
