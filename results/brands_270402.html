<p>Grrrr. Brands is 8am scrutineering. So even though the circuit is nearby its an early start. Small
compensation was the Vees had the pit lane garages. The team reserved the garage the night before with
the proverbial towel. I set off early to arrive in good time and ended up getting there too early (for
me anyway). Having never been to Brands hatch I drove past the paddock entrance, was I driving too
fast ? I was expecting a sign announcing my arrival instead it was a piece of cardboard on a pole and
the entrance is through an industrial estate, not what I had imagined.

<p>In the pits I found the towel and unloaded the car. Then hiked over to the admin office outside the
track to sign on, stopping to look down paddock hill bend (luckily more frightening on foot than in a
car). Scrutineering was a breeze because the scrutineers came over to us (thank you !). I was
practicing in the first session. The lap record is 53 seconds and I set myself the target of 57 secs.
Brands Hatch is a lovely track. Plenty of gradient changes and corners, in fact the straights are not
straights. I was thoroughly enjoying myself when practice finished. While the next practice session
were waiting the commentator read out the times from our session. "12th fastest - Tony Dowson -
55.953". I was quite pleased with that effort. The commentator then preceded to say I was the last
person to automatically make the final. He corrected himself and then just about everyone in the next
session went quicker and I was pushed down to 32nd overall. The 10 drivers in front of me were all covered
by a second so it was going to be a close race.

<p><b><hr>Fastest Practice Lap: 55:953 - 78.89 MPH<hr></b>

<p>In between the race and practice we fitted a new exhaust bought from John Mitchell. It proved a little
painful fitting it when Ian stripped the thread on the studs holding the exhaust on. I quick bit of improvisation
and with me and my mate Simon hacking the bodywork we had it all finished just before the first race. I pressed
the button to start the engine. Nothing. The relay in the starter motor circuit had gone. A quick bypass
job and it fired first time.

<p>I don't remember too much of the start. I remember Richard Harris being 3rd on the grid and I overtook
him by the first corner. I remembered reading an article a month earlier by Johnny Herbert. He was
describing his epic win in the Formula Ford festival. In the practice session he threw it off at
Paddock Hill bend on his first or second lap and therefore earned himself a back of the grid position
for the heat. Not the place to be when you have the creme of European formula ford drivers/brats in
front of you. But with some splendid driving, Brands being a circuit he knew well, he managed to work
his way nearer to the front in the next few races. For the final he was 3rd on the grid. Johnny
reasoned that 3rd on the grid was the best place to be at Brand, pole and second start on an uphill
gradient whereas 3rd and 4th are on the level. Anyway he past the 2 guys in front of him from the
start and went on to win easily. I told Richard this story and what did he do, unwittingly turn off
the ignition as the lights went green. Bravo. There was some jostling over the next few laps but I
found myself in a 5 car train and was holding on to the back of Richard (who went 1.3 seconds quicker
than me in practice). Then the yellow and black quarter flag came out. The most misunderstood flag in
the history of motorsport. I know that the leader on seeing the flag should slow gently to about 50
mph and everyone catch up to form one long train doing 50 mph. So our 5 driver train slowed to about
50-60 mph while the people in front carried on at 70-80 mph. A gap opened pretty quick and now we
needed to catch up which meant going at near race pace. I was accelerating hard out of Clearways
to just keep up with the guys in front thinking "Some people have not got a clue what this flag means"
when there was a noise like a machine gun and no power. I dipped the clutch straight away and coasted
to halt opposite the pits. I watched the rest of the race which went on for an extra 2 laps. The black
and yellow quarter was out for about 2 to 3 laps, seems like the officials don't know how it works.

<p>Back in the pits someone quickly pointed out that there was a hole in the block. Oh dear. Engine
rebuild time. A few offers of lending an engine for the next race came in but I declined them. I
wanted to race with my own engine and the money saved by not racing at Donnington would help to pay
for this rebuild. Ian, my mechanic, quickly volunteered his services to rebuild the engine. So we took
it out of the car and popped it into the boot of his car. Part of me was a little apprehensive about
letting him rebuild it but the other part thought "what's the worse could happen".
