<p><b><hr>Fastest Practice Lap: 54:53 - 80.95 MPH<hr></b>

<p>Last year we blew the engine up, this year I was hoping for better. I set myself a target of achieving a lap 2 seconds slower than the lap record. The lap record of 52.50 is held by Trevor Welsh. So the target this year was 54.5. Last year I achieved a 55.95. So I was looking for a 1.5 second improvement. I was confident I could do it. Last year it was my first visit to Brands and I was taking Paddock Hill bend in third (later I found that this is really a fourth gear corner) so there was time to be found there.

<p>For the first few laps I tried to pickup some lines. Paddock Hill bend seemed more daunting than last year and throughout practice I approached it gingerly with a sort of gentle brake then turn into it using the service road on the left as a marker. Once the apex came into view then like everyone else I became confident again. Its that 2 seconds as you pass under the start bridge/gantry and approach what seems like the end of the track. All I can see from my low down position is 20 metres of track in front of me and then sky.

<p>In practice I had Guy Bellingham behind me for a few laps and I also stayed in front of John Randall for a few laps. Around pretty much of the track I could edge away from John (Surtess flat with a bit of a slide being thoroughly enjoyable) but then he would make it all back up from the exit of Clearways to Paddock Hill bend. Conscious of holding him up I let him through on the way to Druids, I thought I'd follow him and try and learn what I was doing wrong out of Clearways. I spent the last part of the session following John. I could see from my pit board that I done a 54 but was it 54.9 or 54.1 - I must tell my Dad to put the tenths on the board. Turned out to be a 54.53. Target achieved, job done.

<p><hr><b>Heat: Grid Position: 8th<br>
Heat: Race Result: 10th<br>
Heat: Fastest Lap: 55.02 - 80.23 MPH<hr></b>

<p>It was going to be a close race. All of the 5 drivers in front of me on the grid were only 1 tenth quicker. I managed an OK start (for me that translates to I only lost 2 places) and was in 10th place. I overtook John Stapleton on lap 3 and then the next lap Jamie Conyers disappeared (gearbox), So back to where I started - 8th place. John Stapleton reovertook me. Then on consecutive laps I left a big gaping door open (and I mean wide open) into Druids and John Hughes, Brandon Thomas and Paul Nicholls went past. The light bulb came on in my head. I was too slow exiting Paddock and I could at least make the other drivers break into a sweat by not leaving it so open. I finished 10th kicking myself a bit.

<p><hr><b>Final: Grid Position: 21st<br>
Final: Race Result: 18th<br>
Final: Fastest Lap: 54.98 - 80.29 MPH<hr></b>

<p>For the final I had a poor start (22nd to 28th). Time for a come back. I overtook a couple of cars and by lap 5 I was on the back of a group of 5: Phil Waterhouse, Ian Fuller, Jamie Hall and Steve Glasswell. Paddock Hill and Druids offered me 2 opportunities and then going through Surtess, I was about 30 metres behind Jamie Hall when he spun. I kept my foot in and kept my line and he sailed off to the left. Three places in one lap. Through Surtess Phil was having some good fun with the car out of line but being well held. A lap later, Phil made a mistake into Clearway and went wide. Another place. Then I had to get out my binoculars. The next cars was 8 second down the track. With little hope of catching them I just needed to pull away from the group behind me. Easier said then done. Around Clearway, Steve Glasswell could exit with more speed which meant a guaranteed attack into Paddock. Then starting the last lap I had a good run out of Clearways and I overtook into Paddock. The rest of the lap I kept my nose clean particularly Clearways and kept the 18th place.
