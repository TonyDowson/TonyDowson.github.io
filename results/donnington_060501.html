When the fixture list was published I was thrilled to see a round at Donnington Park.The first motor race I had ever seen was at Donnington as an impressionable 12 year old. In fact I had my first single seater experience at Donnington. A few years ago I did a half day initial trial in a Formula Vauxhall Junior. I did 8 laps of the National circuit behind a Vauxall Vectra. They wouldn't let us drive around on our own. Their reason; they could show us the line and speed us up gradually. I hadn't tested at Donnington ever so those 8 laps were all my experience.

<p>Practice was also qualifying. 39 cars entered, only 34 allowed to start. 5 people were going to go home unlucky. So for practice I had to learn the circuit quickly and put in a half decent lap. The pressure was on. I had read about the Donnington circuit in the Autosport guide the day before. The Guide details lines around all the UK and some European circuit. It gives good advice and if I ever a problem or don't think I am going quick enough around a particular corner I have a quick read of this book. So with ideas of lines and braking points in my head I set off to qualify. After a couple of laps I had worked out Craner curve was flat. The guide said the turning point is before thebrow and is blind. Knowing this information had meant I could take the corner flat sooner rather than later and concentrate on find speed elsewhere. Doing some homework had probably helped me qualify. With only 15 minutes to qualify and a 2.5 mile circuit meant only 8 laps. I drove Craner curves well and the Old Hairpin I was quick but I took it on fourth gear and meant I struggled up the hill to MacCleans. My two worst corners were MacCLeans (too slow) and Redgates (Entering too fast and missing the apex). I had driven poorly but felt I had qualifed and I had - 30th. I was faster than 9 cars and didn't feel I was anywhere near a good lap.

Race Result: 27 - 20:19.0 - 73.73MPH<br>
Fastest Lap: 1:58.6<hr></b>

The Vees were the last race of the day. In between qualifying and racing there were a TGP F1 race and saloons and kit cars. The F1 race had to be stopped and so when we hit the track it was 6 o'clock. A good 6 hours wait. Boy was I bored. I was looking forward to the race. I thought I could easily improve my lap time and position. A poor start meant I was next to last. For the next few laps I followed Steve Cooper closely but has he improved he pulled away and my performance stayed the same. So I circulated on my own. A bit boring. I finished 27th. I was disappointed with my position and my lonely boring race. Then I got my lap times. I had lapped slower than qualifying when I felt I had gone quicker. I was ready for home.
