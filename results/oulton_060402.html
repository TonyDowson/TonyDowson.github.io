<p><b><hr>Fastest Practice Lap: 1:16:412 - 77.92 MPH<hr></b>

<p>A Saturday meeting at Oulton was always going to be a test of stamina. Its about 5 hours drive from London (going via my parents). Its was also an early start with scrutineering at 8:25. Practice was a mess, it started late and much of the circuit had been nicely oiled. First lap - yellows at Lodge, next lap - Peter K had a bit of an accident at Druids and his car was stranded on the track. The marshalls moved it but it took 5 laps. Then there was more yellows as a few people spun trying to put in times in the last few minutes. Also I was in traffic and couldn't get a clear lap when there was no yellows. A 1:16.9 is rubbish but I was surprised to be 28th overall and 16th for the heat. I thought it would be a lot worse. 

<p><hr><b>Grid Position: 16<br>
Race Result: 11 - 18:42.709 - 79.55 MPH<br>
Fastest Lap: 1:12.056<hr></b>

<p>I got a good start and overtook a few people of the line and round the first lap. In between practice and the race we had played around with the handling (with the help of Fergus Dalton) and the car felt good. Also the engine felt very punchy and I had no problems with keeping up with people. After a couple of laps I caught up to Ian Fuller and there I stayed. I overtook him once but he repassed me straight away. Then somebody caught me up and managed to pass us both as I tried to pass Ian. I finished in 11th about a second behind Ian, very happy with my performance but feeling if I could have stayed ahead of Ian I might have held onto 9th and done even better.

<p><hr><b>Grid Position: 23<br>
Race Result: 21 - 17:26.632 - 79.64 MPH<br>
Fastest Lap: 1:12.400<hr></b>

Another good start in the second race making up a place or two. I had a tussle with Stuart Feather for about 4 laps, passing and repassing each other. But then Stuart got ahead and pulled away. Then I fell into the jaws of Aaron Aitkens who managed to catch and pass me almost straight away. To my credit I then stayed behind him for the rest of the race but never got close enough to challenge him.

In practice and the two races I didn't feel I got to know the track any better since I last raced here. I felt I was better through Lodge but worse through Old Hall. So overall it evened thing out with a fastest lap slightly better than the last visit. Still at least I finished.
