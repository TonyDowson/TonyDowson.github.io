<p><b><hr>Fastest Practice Lap: 1:11.06 - 75.03 MPH<hr></b>

<p>I haven't driven at Cadwell for a couple of years so I refreshed my memory beforehand using the Autosport Guide. Last time I was here I achieved a 1.11.4 in practice. That was the time to beat and I expected to beat that quite easily. 41 cars were entered for the meeting which would mean the first 16 qualified straight into the final. Qualify in the top 16 was within my grasp despite having no recent experience of the circuit. Also a guaranteed place in the final would save me from a heat and a possible silly mistake and missing the cut.

<p>The first few laps were spent very much trying to find a few lines, brake point etc. I had forgotten much about the circuit apart from which way the corners turned. My Autosport guide is of 1999 vintage. This meant some of the features like the first kerb in Charlie2 had gone and I couldn't find 3 apex kerbs at Chris curve. So a few tweeks of the guide then down to the business of picking up speed. The gremlins were creeping in and the first 3 laps I was fumbling for second gear at the hairpin. I found by sitting in my car in the garage that a less ham fisted and more gentle approach to changing gears seemed to produce better results. So a few mutterings of "Be gentle" and I started to find that second gear. As the session wore on I started to take Charlie1 flat with a slight lift into Charlie2, I experimented around Chris Curve, holding it in third all the way round and into the Gooseneck or changing into 4th for a few second before changing back down for the Gooseneck. The holding in third seemed to work ok with it hitting the rev limiter (I think set to 7.5K) and allowed me to get a smoother run into the Gooseneck. With 5 minutes of the session left and having rattled off my fastest lap and going faster still, I braked for Park a little too much and so went in a little slower than I would have liked. To my surprise the backend started to move a little. I corrected a little thinking there was no problem and carried on accelerating. But it carried on coming around, now I was in a save situation and I didn't get the lock on quick enough. Around it came and I shot off into the inside of the circuit. Much grass cutting later I found the circuit again and gingerly made my way around another lap cleaning up the tyres. Ready for one last go at a quick one but the bloke with the chequered flag had other ideas. End of session and a 1.11.06 in the bag. Reasonably happy. My dad fetched the practice sheet and came back smiling which either meant I was on pole for the heat or straight in the final. I was 15th and straight into the final

<p><hr><b>Final: Grid Position: 15<br>
Final: Race Result: 15<br>
Final: Fastest Lap: 1:10.23 0 - 75.92 MPH<hr></b>

<p>Having watched the heat I was interested to know what times people had done in the heat. This would be the guys directly behind me I wondered if the 12 laps of extra practice had resulted in much faster times by them. The fastest lap was a few tenths quicker than my practice time so I wasn't unduly worried

<p>My starts of been average to rubbish this year. I either fumble for second gear or if I have a what I think is a good start everyone around me seems to be going past. After the Donnington race with time on our hands in the scrutineering bay I was talking to Steve Glasswell who went past me off the start. He told me his starting technique. With the new "be gentle" on the gearchange and Steve's start technique I was determined to get off the line well. On the green flag lap, practice lap, I let the clutch out and Simon Readman in front of me didn't. No problems I just braked and waited but then my mind started to think, what if that happens on the real start. Cadwell is awfully narrow. For the real start I didn't react to the green as fast as I should but once moving it all worked well. Second gear engaged nicely. I remeber Alan in front of me and Steve Ough along side as we went into the first turn. I dont think Graham Kiddy past me. Ok, losing 1 places off the start and 1 into the first corner is not going to win races but I was pleased.

<p>My dad thought I was slow in the hairpin during practice so for the race I intended to attack it. First lap and at the hairpin I was fumbling for that second gear. Luckily I found it and didn't lose any places. On the third time around I missed it again and had a polite nudge from the back. Then after that no problems. Highlight of the race were a few encounters into the hairpin; I was on the outside of Steve Ough and he jinked left and we banged wheels, then as we accelerated up to Charlies I was jammed on to his gearbox but didn't manage to squeeze past into Charlies. Then ahead of him Mark Dunham went wide at Park. Steve nipped past him easily and as I accelerated along side, we both went into Chris Curve, Mark came across and we interlocked wheels and with my inside wheels on the grass somehow we managed not to touch and I get back on to the tarmac. A few laps later, I came out of Mansfield behind Mark and got a run on him into the hairpin where he defended the inside line and Warren Smith (I think) tried to overtake me on the inside, locked up and looked like he was going to go straight into Mark, a little light contact and with me on the outside of the pair of them could not get around and past them. Then with 2 laps to go going down the back straight there are some yellow flags and Mark slows down dramatically. I also slowed so as not to overtake him. I am slightly confused, maybe he can see a red flag that I can't see but the marshall is waving yellow. Then Mark speeds up and I am little bewildered and I let him get a couple of seconds away. With only a lap to go I have to be content with my position and I defend Mike Fenwick off behind me without too much difficulty and finish 15th. I lost 5 places but also 5 drivers in front of me fell off. I probably could have finished 12th if I didn't have those few incidents but that's motor racing.
