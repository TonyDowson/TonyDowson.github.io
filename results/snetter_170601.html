<p><b><hr>Fastest Practice Lap: 1:25.767 81.93MPH<hr></b>

The previous day it had bucketed it down so we were glad to have obtained a garage for Snetterton. Practice was again qualifying with only 32 cars allowed, 5 drivers were going to miss the cut. The circuit was cold and a little damp so I was reasonably happy with a 1:25.7 although I wasn't happy with the power and therefore speed down Revitt straight.

<p><hr><b>Final: Grid Position: 26th<br>
Final: Race Result (7 laps) : 19th - 10:32.920 - 77.72MPH<br>
Final: Fastest Lap: 1:25.438<hr></b>

Another OK start (lost 2 places) was followed by losing more places down Revitt straight. People seems to be just streaming past me. 3 laps into the race it was stopped when I think Craig Davis had a coming together and ended upside down. At the restart a poorer than OK start and it seemed like everyone was streaming pass me on the straight

<p>A few went off at the bomb hole and then a few more at Russells. I took to the grass to avoid Nick Brown. I felt a bit better after losing so many places on lap one and drove a little more determined. But the power on the straight wasn't there. I was close to people coming out of Sears but I found I couldn't tow past them and would hold position behind them until the end of the straight when the speed was greater and the tow bigger. I laboured on and then with a couple of laps to go the oil light flashed on. I carried on and it flashed on a few more times and foolishily I carried on. On the last lap the presure had dropped and I coasted home. In hindsight I should have switched off and saved the engine. I told my engine man John and he advised me to have it rebuilt. Once stripped, he said the crankshaft was badly worn and it probably wouldn't have lasted another few miles without blowing the engine. With Pembrey next, a double header, plus testing I could ill afford to do a few miles and then blow an engine with no replacement available.
