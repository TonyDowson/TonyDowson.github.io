<p><b>Practice</b><br>
33 cars were entered and only the first 32 qualifiers would actually race. Which was kind of worrying but a quick bit of maths revealed that only 31 were actually going to attempt to practice. A few guys hadn’t turned up. Weather and track was cold. Tried to increase pace on second lap. Tyres too cold and had to hold a slide through Riches. But throughout practice the car felt lively at the back. On a couple of laps towards the end I got a good run through Russell and turned in a 1.24.43. Six seconds quicker than the last time I was here (my first race last year). The sort of improvement I was hoping for. It put me 19th on the grid.
<hr><p><b>Pre-Race</b><br>
I mentioned to John that the back end felt lively. Mind you a few drivers had said there was not a lot of grip out there. John asked me about damper setting and had I set up the Z-bar. I wasn’t sure of the setting and I didn’t know how to set up the Z-bar. Well the dampers needed softening and the Z-bar was way out. John did his best but the rods were too short so we got an improved set up but not the best. 
<hr><p><b>Race</b><br>
As we waited in the assembly area some menacing black clouds started heading our way. I was quite surprised it wasn’t raining when we hit the circuit. Off the start line I got a reasonable start but two drivers came past. I blocked everyone else and managed to head down Revett straight in what I reckoned was 21st. Bit of a gap in front of me, I came into Russell and saw a couple of cars had collided and were blocking the middle of the track. I got around them but now the guys in front were way ahead. That was disappointing and I thought I was going to have a drive to the flag but a couple of laps later the guys behind started catching me. The guy behind tried to overtake me twice on the iside to the Esses and Riches but I just held my line and braked fairly late which put him off. He finally overtook me into the Esses and on the same lap I exited Russell poorly and another driver wnet past me going into Riches. I let him go fully expecting to get him back down Revett straight. But when I braked for Sears, nothing. The wheels locked instantly, it had rained at the corner since the last time we been around. I was stunned I didn’t hit the guy in front he scrambled around and I almost did but probably because I was completely off the throttle the car was totally unsettled and it came around. As I sat on the outside of the corner I thought I might be hit by the next load of guys. I started the engine and watched them go past and two of them spin just have to me. I started moving and retook those places. For the rest of the race I cheesly continued to the flag. Not happy with the wet/dry track. I finished 21st but at one point I was 14th. It could have been so much better.
