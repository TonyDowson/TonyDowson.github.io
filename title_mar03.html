<p>In between the test session and the race at Mallory I had a go at
reducing the play in the UJ joints by filling them with  silicone
sealant and wrapping them in rubber. The improvement was marginal. So I
ordered a pair of the bona fide joints from  Demon Tweeks which duly
arrived with a new ignition switch. No time to fit them UJs before the <a href="results/mallory_090303.html">Mallory race</a>

<p>In between Mallory and Donnington I had to refit the carburettor
(removed at Mallory to allow the scrutineers to check the  restrictor
plate). There was also a small crack in one of the pushrod tubes that I
tried to patch up. In an effort to improve  the gear change I decided to
buy the proper joints from Demon Tweeks. Ian had cut some tubing and
extracted the old linkage.  I took the bits to the welders in Ealing
(Reg Cole). Attempt number 1 - The tubing Ian gave me contained too much
lead content and so the welds were very weak. Attempt number 2 - With
some hefty steel tubing they constructed what I wanted but  when I
fitted it to the car I found that the angles were wrong, the linkage was
not clearing the gearbox. Attempt 3 -  Angles wrong again. Attempt 4 -
Eureka - It worked and the sloppiness is reduced to nearly nothing.

<p>At the <a href="results/donn_290303.html">Donnington race</a>, Ian put on the Demon Tweeks stickers. Now to scour Autosport/Motoring News etc for photos of my car.

<p>We finished the Donnington race with a rough sounding engine which
transpired to be one of the exhaust manifolds had come  loose. A not so
quick 10 minutes tightening it (it would have to be the most awkward
bolt to get to) and problem solved. The small crack in the pushrod tube
had become worse (or maybe it was leaking from where it mated with the
cylinder head - hard to tell because of the amount of oil). It was now
coming out and hitting the exhaust, hence the smoke during the race. After the race I
took the car around to Ian's house in Chesterfield for him to take  the
head off and replace the pushrod tubes. On that Sunday morning we also
fitted a new switch and also worked out the oil temperature gauge
fitted over winter was not working because the sender unit was faulty.

<p>I left Chesterfield for London with the car fully fixed and ready for Brands Hatch in two weeks time.
