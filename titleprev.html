<h1>Winter work</h1>
<p>Well the long winter is over and the first test is around the corner at Mallory on the 11th March. So what has changed...
<ul>
<li>Ian's garage in Chesterfield has been rebuilt. He now has much more space (and for me more headroom), central heating, toilet, level floor and kitchen sink.
<li>New dashboard - The old one was looking a little tired and a bit of wheeling and dealing by Ian netted us some carbon fibre which Ian has used to replace the bit of tin we had.
<li>8 wheels - I've been busy buying Empi 8 wheels on ebay with various success. 80 quid for 4 and 120 quid for 4. The expensive 4 were in not a great state but all 8 have been cleaned and repainted.
<li>Seating position - the seat has been moved back and is now secure at the bottom. The pedals have been moved back to try and stop my feet fouling on the steering rack
<li>Head change - We swapped the head back to the GAC pair we bought earlier this year.
</ul>
<p>These are the races I plan to do this year
