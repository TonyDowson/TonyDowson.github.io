<h2 align=center>February</h2>

<a href="title_jan03.html">January's Diary</a>
 
<p>Been a bit busy over the last couple of months with racing, earning the dosh to pay for it and holidays etc. So here is what happened in February and I'll be adding March and 2 race reports in the next few days.
 
<h3>Finishing off the winter rebuild</h3>
 
<p>In the run up to the end of February Mallory test, Ian refitted the fire extinguisher. He moved it from the left side back to the right and mounted it lower in the car. There were a couple of setbacks, a damaged thread on a engine plate required a replacement sending from John Bowles and new spacers were required from Steve Glasswell. Ian also had trouble creating a new gear linkage for the new gear selector bought from Steve Glasswell. When the UJ joints were welded the UJ joints became ultra sloppy because incorporated into the joint is a small string. When the joint is welded, it heats up and the spring breaks. So he drilled out the pins and remade them using washers, nuts and bolts. The final thing done was to setup the car. All 4 corners of the car had been played with over winter so Ian took it to a local tyre dealer (Wingerworth Tyres) to have all the toe-in adjusted. Then the ride height was set and the camber adjusted to the required setting.
 
<h3>Mallory Test Session</h3>
 
<p>There was quite a few Vee drivers at the test session and some old faces and some new faces like Phil Waterhouse who has bought Ricky Cole's ARI. The first session for me was cut short prematurely when the engine cut out. I coasted into the paddock (when I really should have coasted into the pits). After a few jabs on the starter it fired again and I got out do a couple more laps before the session was over. The second session same thing, engine went dead coming out of the hairpin. This time I coasted into the pits.  A few jabs on the starter and without the jump battery on it didn't sound like it was going to start. So we pushed it back to the pits. Still no luck with the jump battery connected. The fuel pump makes a ticking noise when the ignition is turned on but it was eerily silent. A quick bash with a hammer and it burst back into life. It looked like the fuel pump was on it last legs. We resigned ourselves to try and get some laps in the last session before it finally packed up. I also suspected the ignition switch was playing up. While waiting for the session I turned on the ignition and the pump had stopped working again. I hit the pump but nothing. I then checked the connectors on the back of the ignition switch and the pump started again when I touched them. This didn't make sense. All the electrics to the back of the car run off the same switch. If the switch was faulty the power would have not got to the starter motor. Whatever. 
 
For the next session the car worked fine. Now I could get back to figuring out where second gear was. I think I was getting second about 50% of the time but not quickly. The other times I was finding reverse or fourth. Apart from the gears and the cutting out everything else worked great. Then engine ran well and the handling felt better than ever. The lap times were reasonable but then I was only really running the engine in and checking everything worked. 
 
In between the test session and the race at Mallory I had a go at reducing the play in the UJ joints by filling them with silicone sealant and wrapping them in rubber. The improvement was marginal. So I ordered a pair of the bona fide joints from Demon Tweeks which duly arrived with a new ignition switch.
