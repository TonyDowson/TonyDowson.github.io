<h1 align=center>Before 2000</h1>
<h2><a name="silverstone">Silverstone</a></h2>
<p>Before year 2000 I had done a few racing school days. The first one was at Silverstone, the one day intensive race 
tution course. Excellent course, 400 quid well spent. I did the Saloon car one. Not sure why I didn't do single seater, 
guess I thought I wouldn't be able to get in one being 6ft 4 tall! I learnt loads that day. First part of the day was in 
the classroom, taking an indepth look at driving and how braking, accelerating, steering etc affect the car. Next part was 
out on the track in a Sherpa van. The instructor took us round showing us lines etc. Then out in the cars for a driving 
assessment, then into the skid cars, into another car for hell n toe practice. Then back out on the track for timed laps. 
Pretty packed day.</p>
<h2><a name="donnington">Donnington</a></h2>
<p>The next course was Jim Russell half day thing at Donnington. The difference between this corporate, try a racing car 
day and the race course was immediately apparent. They don't pretend to do anything but whet peoples appetite. A quick go 
in a Vectra and then a spin round the loop to try and get used to the single seater. I was uncomfortably crammed into mine. 
Don't know what anyone else experience of a Formula Vauxhall Junior is like but I'd tell people not to bother if they're 
tall or to be more precise have big feet. My size 12s were always stepping on two pedals. So I hit the circuit in non too 
confident mood. A few adjustments in the pits had improve things and that became apparent out on the circuit and felt much 
more at home. The new problem was the a) we had to follow a Vectra around and b) the guy in front didn't/couldn't keep up. 
So we went around at a snail's pace. Talking to the bloke later he grand delusions that we we're motoring round. The best 
thing for me that day was a discussion in the paddock with the chief instructor, a certain Callum Locke who encouraged me 
with his experiences of racing Formula Vee.</p>
<h2><a name="aintree">Aintree</a></h2>
<p>So after Donnington I thought I needed to do another racing course. I looked at Jim Russell course, now at Silverstone. 
The price in 99 was 2850 quid. I thought this was taking the piss. No doubt a good course but a touch expensive. I then 
found the Aintree racing school up near Liverpool. 425 quid for 60 laps sounded like brilliant value. I didn't appreciate 
how small the track was until I got there. But apart from that, top course. Instructors were brilliant always encouraging 
me to go faster, try harder. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to go racing. 60 laps of the 1 mile trace 
is still 60+ minutes of driving. Godd value for money and you learn loads. Its even worth going on this course if you've 
been racing for a while. This guy know loads about driving. Why spend 1000s on your car when a few hundred quid spent on 
your self could reap bigger dividends.</p>
